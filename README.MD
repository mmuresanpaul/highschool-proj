# Highschool Projects

A collection of projects made by me during highschool. They were all done with basic C# knowlegde, some of them being small utility apps I might've neededfor a specific task. Efficienty wise, they are quite efficient, but not really organized properly since I was not accustomed to OOP at that time. Feel free to use them or improve them!

## List of apps: 
* **Alarm:** A small alarm utility that does what it says on the tin.	
* **AppBlocks:**  Inspired by Cold Turkey, I wanted to create my own blocking app to avoid distractions when working.	
* **ChessGame:**  My attempt at creating a chess game.	
* **Cruce:** a  North-Western Romanian card game.	
* **Pseudocoder:**  A small utility app that converts Java code into Pseudocode.	
* **N0tepad 0.1.4:** My final year's project. a note taking app with material design. Focus is on design rather than functionality.
